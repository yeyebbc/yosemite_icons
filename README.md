# Yosemite Icons

Icons collection from Mac OS X Yosemite to Catalina. Some of them are my personal redesigns, some are original icons, and some are resized to fit Yosemite icon grid lines.

## Why

Because why not.

## How to use

#### Finding icons

Currently, use GitHub’s [Go to file](https://github.com/yeyebbc/yosemite_icons/find/master) button to search for icons.  
Or you could just clone the entire repository.

#### Using icons

1. Open PNG file in Preview.app, copy it.
2. Open “Get Info” window from application’s context menu.
3. Select by clicking the app’s icon to the top left of the “Info” window. Paste it, done.

For `.icns` file, I personally just open it with Preview.app, select the one with highest resolution and click “Export As…” in the context menu and export into PNG format.
